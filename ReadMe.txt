I wanted to consolidate University studies from previous Semester by

1) Drawing data from an API (First attampt at leveraging an API) via Python
2) Cleaning that data in Python
3) Building a DB schema in PostgreSQL via Python
4) Loading thecleaned data to that schema
5) Importing the DB schema into PowerBI and visualising.

I've covered all of these - it's very untidy and could be achived more simply - 
but the learning from Semester 1 has been reinforced with new elements added!
